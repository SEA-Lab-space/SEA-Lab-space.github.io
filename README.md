## Overview

This is the lab website code that can be maintained collaboratively.

- Go to `content/authors`
- Create a new folder named `firstname-middlename-lastname` (all lower cases) that is consistent with the name that you used for paper publications. If you don't use a middle name, the folder will be simply named as `firstname-lastname`.
  - E.g., "Xuhai Xu" will become `xuhai-xu`, "Anind K Dey" will become `anind-k-dey`.
  - Making the folder name consistent with your name in publications (i.e., bib file, more in [add publication](#add-pub) section) will link your page with the papers listed in the [Publication](https://sea-lab.space/publication/) page.
- Copy a template `_index.md` from `content/authors/0-author-template` to the new folder. Fill in with your personal content. Feel free to take a look at others' `md` for reference.
- Add a personal headshot to the new folder. Name it as `avatar`, with the original file extension `[png/jpg/jpeg]`. Please make the photo to be square for the best visualization on the page.
