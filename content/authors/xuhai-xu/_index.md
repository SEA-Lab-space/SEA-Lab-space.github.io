Hi! I am an incoming Assistant Professor at Columbia University, Dept of Biomedical Informatics. I focus on applying human-computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI) methods for health applications.

I lead the [SEA (Sense, Empower, and Augment) Lab](https://sea-lab.space). We aim to leverage everyday data and build better human-centered methods, devices, and systems to sense, empower, and augment human health and well-being.
