abstract: There are large individual differences in physiological processes, making
  designing personalized health sensing algorithms challenging. Existing machine learning
  systems struggle to generalize well to unseen subjects or contexts and can often
  contain problematic biases. Video-based physiological measurement is no exception.
  Therefore, learning personalized or customized models from a small number of unlabeled
  samples is very attractive as it would allow fast calibrations to improve generalization
  and help correct biases. In this paper, we present a novel meta-learning approach
  called MetaPhys for personalized video-based cardiac measurement for non-contact
  pulse and heart rate monitoring. Our method uses only 18-seconds of video for customization
  and works effectively in both supervised and unsupervised manners. We evaluate our
  approach on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior performance in cross-dataset
  evaluation with substantial reductions (42% to 44%) in errors compared with state-of-the-art
  approaches. We also find that our method leads to large reductions in bias due to
  skin type.
