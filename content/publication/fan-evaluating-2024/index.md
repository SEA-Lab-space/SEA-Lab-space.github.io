abstract: Smartphones hold a great variety of personal data during usage, which at
  the same time poses privacy risks. In this paper, we used the selling price to reflect
  users' privacy valuation of their personal data on smartphones. In a 7-day auction,
  they sold their data as commodities and earn money. We first designed a total of
  49 commodities with 8 attributes, covering 14 common types of personal data on smartphones.
  Then, through a large-scale reverse second price auction (N=181), we examined students'
  valuation of 15 representative commodities. The average bid-price was 62.8 CNY (8.68
  USD) and a regression model with 14 independent variables found the most influential
  factors for bid-price to be privacy risk, ethnic and gender. When validating our
  results on non-students (N=34), we found that despite they gave significantly higher
  prices (M=109.8 CNY, 15.17 USD), \"privacy risk\" was still one of the most influential
  factors among the 17 independent variables in the regression model. We recommended
  that stakeholders should provide 8 attributes of data when selling or managing it.
