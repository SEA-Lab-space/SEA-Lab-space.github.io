abstract: 'Foundation models have become invaluable in advancing the medical field.
  Despite their promise, the strategic deployment of LLMs for effective utility in
  complex medical tasks remains an open question. Our novel framework, Medical Decision-making
  Agents (MDAgents) aims to address this gap by automatically assigning the effective
  collaboration structure for LLMs. Assigned solo or group collaboration structure
  is tailored to the complexity of the medical task at hand, emulating real-world
  medical decision making processes. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods
  with state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of challenging medical benchmarks: MedQA,
  MedMCQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, PMC-VQA, Path-VQA, and MedVidQA, achieving the best
  performance in 5 out of 7 benchmarks that require an understanding of multi-modal
  medical reasoning. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents excels in adapting the
  number of collaborating agents to optimize efficiency and accuracy, showcasing its
  robustness in diverse scenarios. We also explore the dynamics of group consensus,
  offering insights into how collaborative agents could behave in complex clinical
  team dynamics. Our code can be found at https://github.com/mitmedialab/MDAgents.'
