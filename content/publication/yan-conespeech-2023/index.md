abstract: Remote communication is essential for efficient collaboration among people
  at different locations. We present ConeSpeech, a virtual reality (VR) based multi-user
  remote communication technique, which enables users to selectively speak to target
  listeners without distracting bystanders. With ConeSpeech, the user looks at the
  target listener and only in a cone-shaped area in the direction can the listeners
  hear the speech. This manner alleviates the disturbance to and avoids overhearing
  from surrounding irrelevant people. Three featured functions are supported, directional
  speech delivery, size-adjustable delivery range, and multiple delivery areas, to
  facilitate speaking to more than one listener and to listeners spatially mixed up
  with bystanders. We conducted a user study to determine the modality to control
  the cone-shaped delivery area. Then we implemented the technique and evaluated its
  performance in three typical multi-user communication tasks by comparing it to two
  baseline methods. Results show that ConeSpeech balanced the convenience and flexibility
  of voice communication.
