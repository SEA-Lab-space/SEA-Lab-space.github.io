abstract: Academic achievement in the first year of college is critical for setting
  students on a pathway toward long-term academic and life success, yet little is
  known about the factors that shape early college academic achievement. Given the
  important role sleep plays in learning and memory, here we extend this work to evaluate
  whether nightly sleep duration predicts change in end-of-semester grade point average
  (GPA). First-year college students from three independent universities provided
  sleep actigraphy for a month early in their winter/spring academic term across five
  studies. Findings showed that greater early-term total nightly sleep duration predicted
  higher end-of-term GPA, an effect that persisted even after controlling for previous-term
  GPA and daytime sleep. Specifically, every additional hour of average nightly sleep
  duration early in the semester was associated with an 0.07 increase in end-of-term
  GPA. Sensitivity analyses using sleep thresholds also indicated that sleeping less
  than 6 h each night was a period where sleep shifted from helpful to harmful for
  end-of-term GPA, relative to previous-term GPA. Notably, predictive relationships
  with GPA were specific to total nightly sleep duration, and not other markers of
  sleep, such as the midpoint of a student’s nightly sleep window or bedtime timing
  variability. These findings across five studies establish nightly sleep duration
  as an important factor in academic success and highlight the potential value of
  testing early academic term total sleep time interventions during the formative
  first year of college.
