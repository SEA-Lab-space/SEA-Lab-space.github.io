abstract: Despite the growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
  for content analysis, current studies have primarily focused on text-based content.
  In the present work, we explored the potential of LLMs in assisting video content
  analysis by conducting a case study that followed a new workflow of LLM-assisted
  multimodal content analysis. The workflow encompasses codebook design, prompt engineering,
  LLM processing, and human evaluation. We strategically crafted annotation prompts
  to get LLM Annotations in structured form and explanation prompts to generate LLM
  Explanations for a better understanding of LLM reasoning and transparency. To test
  LLM’s video annotation capabilities, we analyzed 203 keyframes extracted from 25
  YouTube short videos about depression. We compared the LLM Annotations with those
  of two human coders and found that LLM has higher accuracy in object and activity
  Annotations than emotion and genre Annotations. Moreover, we identified the potential
  and limitations of LLM’s capabilities in annotating videos. Based on the findings,
  we explore opportunities and challenges for future research and improvements to
  the workflow. We also discuss ethical concerns surrounding future studies based
  on LLM-assisted video analysis.
