abstract: Recent advances in ultra-low-power ubiquitous touch interfaces make touch
  inputs possible anytime, anywhere. However, their functions are usually pre-determined,
  i.e., one button is only associated with one fixed function. BoldMove enables spontaneous
  and efficient association of touch inputs and IoT device functions with semantic-based
  function filtering and a wait-confirm sequential selection strategy. In this way,
  such touch interfaces become ubiquitous IoT device controllers. We proposed the
  semantic-based IoT function filtering to improve control efficiency, then designed
  the sequential selection mechanism for interfaces with constrained input and output
  resources. We implemented BoldMove on a custom-built touch interface with capacitive
  button inputs and a smartwatch display. We then conducted a user study to determine
  the design parameters for the sequential selection method. At last, we validated
  that BoldMove only takes 3.25 seconds to complete a selection task if the target
  function appears within the Top-3 displayed item. Even if the assumption is relaxed
  to Top-10, BoldMove is still estimated to be more efficient than the conventional
  selection method with device-based filtering and menu-navigated selection.
