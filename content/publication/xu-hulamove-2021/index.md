abstract: We present HulaMove, a novel interaction technique that leverages the movement
  of the waist as a new eyes-free and hands-free input method for both the physical
  world and the virtual world. We frst conducted a user study (N=12) to understand
  users’ ability to control their waist. We found that users could easily discriminate
  eight shifting directions and two rotating orientations, and quickly confrm actions
  by returning to the original position (quick return). We developed a design space
  with eight gestures for waist interaction based on the results and implemented an
  IMU-based real-time system. Using a hierarchical machine learning model, our system
  could recognize waist gestures at an accuracy of 97.5%. Finally, we conducted a
  second user study (N=12) for usability testing in both real-world scenarios and
  virtual reality settings. Our usability study indicated that HulaMove signifcantly
  reduced interaction time by 41.8% compared to a touch screen method, and greatly
  improved users’ sense of presence in the virtual world. This novel technique provides
  an additional input method when users’ eyes or hands are busy, accelerates users’
  daily operations, and augments their immersive experience in the virtual world.
