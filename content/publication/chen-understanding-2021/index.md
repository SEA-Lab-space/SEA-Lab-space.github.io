abstract: As wearable devices move toward the face (i.e. smart earbuds, glasses),
  there is an increasing need to facilitate intuitive interactions with these devices.
  Current sensing techniques can already detect many mouth-based gestures; however,
  usersâ€™ preferences of these gestures are not fully understood. In this paper, we
  investigate the design space and usability of mouth-based microgestures. We first
  conducted brainstorming sessions (N=16) and compiled an extensive set of 86 user-defined
  gestures. Then, with an online survey (N=50), we assessed the physical and mental
  demand of our gesture set and identified a subset of 14 gestures that can be performed
  easily and naturally. Finally, we conducted a remote Wizard-of-Oz usability study
  (N=11) mapping gestures to various daily smartphone operations under a sitting and
  walking context. From these studies, we develop a taxonomy for mouth gestures, finalize
  a practical gesture set for common applications, and provide design guidelines for
  future mouth-based gesture interactions.
