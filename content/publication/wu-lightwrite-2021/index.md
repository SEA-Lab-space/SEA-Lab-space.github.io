abstract: Learning to write is challenging for blind and low vision (BLV) people because
  of the lack of visual feedback. Regardless of the drastic advancement of digital
  technology, handwriting is still an essential part of daily life. Although tools
  designed for teaching BLV to write exist, many are expensive and require the help
  of sighted teachers. We propose LightWrite, a low-cost, easy-to-access smartphone
  application that uses voice-based descriptive instruction and feedback to teach
  BLV users to write English lowercase letters and Arabian digits in a specifically
  designed font. A two-stage study with 15 BLV users with little prior writing knowledge
  shows that LightWrite can successfully teach users to learn handwriting characters
  in an average of 1.09 minutes for each letter. After initial training and 20-minute
  daily practice for 5 days, participants were able to write an average of 19.9 out
  of 26 letters that are recognizable by sighted raters.
