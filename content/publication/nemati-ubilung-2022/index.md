abstract: Lung health assessment is traditionally done mainly through X-ray images
  and spirometry tests which are time-consuming, cumbersome, and costly. In this paper,
  we investigate the potential of passively recordable contents such as speech, cough
  and heart signal for such an assessment. Our regression model is the first in the
  literature to achieve mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.47% for estimation of forced
  expiratory volume in 1 sec. (FEV1) over forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio using
  these contents. This is comparable to the state of the art active phone-based spirometry
  methods. Additionally our classification models achieve a F1-score of 0.982 for
  healthy v.s. diseased, 0.881 for obstructive v.s. non-obstructive, 0.854 for chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) v.s. asthma, and 0.892 for severe v.s. non-severe
  obstruction classification.
