abstract: 'In the conversations with smart speakers, misunderstandings of users’ requests
  lead to erroneous responses. We propose FrownOnError, a novel interaction technique
  that enables users to interrupt the responses by intentional but natural facial
  expressions. This method leverages the human nature that the facial expression changes
  when we receive unexpected responses. We conducted a ﬁrst user study (N=12) to understand
  users’ intuitive reactions to the correct and incorrect responses. Our results reveal
  the signiﬁcant difference in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of users’
  facial expressions between two conditions, and frowning and raising eyebrows are
  intuitive to perform and easy to control. Our second user study (N=16) evaluated
  the user experience and interruption efﬁciency of FrownOnError and the third user
  study (N=12) explored suitable conversation recovery strategies after the interruptions.
  Our results show that FrownOnError can be accurately detected (precision: 97.4%,
  recall: 97.6%), provides the most timely interruption compared to the baseline methods
  of wake-up word and button press, and is rated as most intuitive and easiest to
  be performed by users.'
