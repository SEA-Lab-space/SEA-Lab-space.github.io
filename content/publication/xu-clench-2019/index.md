abstract: People eat every day and biting is one of the most fundamental and natural
  actions that they perform on a daily basis. Existing work has explored tooth click
  location and jaw movement as input techniques, however clenching has the potential
  to add control to this input channel. We propose clench interaction that leverages
  clenching as an actively controlled physiological signal that can facilitate interactions.
  We conducted a user study to investigate users’ ability to control their clench
  force. We found that users can easily discriminate three force levels, and that
  they can quickly confirm actions by unclenching (quick release). We developed a
  design space for clench interaction based on the results and investigated the usability
  of the clench interface. Participants preferred the clench over baselines and indicated
  a willingness to use clench-based interactions. This novel technique can provide
  an additional input method in cases where users’ eyes or hands are busy, augment
  immersive experiences such as virtual/augmented reality, and assist individuals
  with disabilities.
