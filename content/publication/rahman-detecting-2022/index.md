abstract: Continuous stress exposure negatively impacts mental and physical well-being.
  Physiological arousal due to stress affects heartbeat frequency, changes breathing
  pattern and peripheral temperature, among several other bodily responses. Traditionally
  stress detection is performed by collecting signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG),
  respiration, and skin conductance response using uncomfortable sensors such as a
  chestband. In this study, we use earbuds that passively measure photoplethysmography
  (PPG), core body temperature, and inertial measurements. We have conducted a lab
  study exposing 18 participants to an evaluated speech task and additional tasks
  aimed at increasing stress or promoting relaxation. We simultaneously collected
  PPG, ECG, impedance cardiography (ICG), and blood pressure using laboratory grade
  equipment as reference measurements. We show that the earbud PPG sensor can reliably
  capture heart rate and heart rate variability. We further show that earbud signals
  can be used to classify the physiological responses associated with stress with
  91.30% recall, 80.52% precision, and 85.12% F1-score using a random forest classifier
  with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The accuracy can further be improved
  through multi-modal sensing. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using
  earbuds for passively monitoring users' physiological responses.
