abstract: Cough event detection is the foundation of any measurement associated with
  cough, one of the primary symptoms of pulmonary illnesses. This paper proposes HearCough,
  which enables continuous cough event detection on edge computing hearables, by leveraging
  always-on active noise cancellation (ANC) microphones in commodity hearables. Specifically,
  we proposed a lightweight end-to-end neural network model — TinyCOUNET and its transfer
  learning based traning method. When evaluated on our acted cough event dataset,
  Tiny-COUNET achieved equivalent detection performance but required significantly
  less computational re­ sources and storage space than cutting-edge cough event detection
  methods. Then we implemented HearCough by quantifying and deploying the pre-trained
  Tiny-COUNET to a popular micro-controller in consumer hearables. Lastly, we evaluated
  that HearCough is effective and reliable for continuous cough event detection through
  a field study with 8 patients. HearCough achieved 2 Hz cough event detection with
  an accuracy of 90.0% and an F1-score of 89.5% by consuming an additional 5.2 mW
  power. We envision HearCough as a low-cost add-on for future hearables to enable
  continuous cough detection and pulmonary health monitoring.
