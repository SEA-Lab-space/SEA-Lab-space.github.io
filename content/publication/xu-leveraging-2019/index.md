abstract: 'The rate of depression in college students is rising, which is known to
  increase suicide risk, lower academic performance and double the likelihood of dropping
  out of school. Existing work on fnding relationships between passively sensed behavior
  and depression, as well as detecting depression, mainly derives relevant unimodal
  features from a single sensor. However, co-occurrence of values in multiple sensors
  may provide better features, because such features can describe behavior in context.
  We present a new method to extract contextually fltered features from passively
  collected, time-series mobile data via association rule mining. After calculating
  traditional unimodal features from the data, we extract rules that relate unimodal
  features to each other using association rule mining. We extract rules from each
  class separately (e.g., depression vs. nondepression). We introduce a new metric
  to select a subset of rules that distinguish between the two classes. From these
  rules, which capture the relationship between multiple unimodal features, we automatically
  extract contextually fltered features. These features are then fed into a traditional
  machine learning pipeline to detect the class of interest (in our case, depression),
  defned by whether a student has a high BDI-II score at the end of the semester.
  The behavior rules generated by our methods are highly interpretable representations
  of diferences between classes. Our best model uses contextually-fltered features
  to signifcantly outperform a standard model that uses only unimodal features, by
  an average of 9.7% across a variety of metrics. We further verifed the generalizability
  of our approach on a second dataset, and achieved very similar results. CCS Concepts:
