abstract: We present a framework for gesture customization requiring minimal examples
  from users, all without degrading the performance of existing gesture sets. To achieve
  this, we frst deployed a large-scale study (N=500+) to collect data and train an
  accelerometer-gyroscope recognition model with a cross-user accuracy of 95.7% and
  a falsepositive rate of 0.6 per hour when tested on everyday non-gesture data. Next,
  we design a few-shot learning framework which derives a lightweight model from our
  pre-trained model, enabling knowledge transfer without performance degradation.
  We validate our approach through a user study (N=20) examining on-device customization
  from 12 new gestures, resulting in an average accuracy of 55.3%, 83.1%, and 87.2%
  on using one, three, or fve shots when adding a new gesture, while maintaining the
  same recognition accuracy and false-positive rate from the pre-existing gesture
  set. We further evaluate the usability of our real-time implementation with a user
  experience study (N=20). Our results highlight the efectiveness, learnability, and
  usability of our customization framework.
