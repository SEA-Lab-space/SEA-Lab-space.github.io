abstract: 'Current web-based maps do not provide visibility into real-time elevator
  outages at urban rail transit stations, disenfranchising commuters (e.g., wheelchair
  users) who rely on functioning elevators at transit stations. In this paper, we
  demonstrate UnlockedMaps, an open-source and open-data web-based map that visualizes
  the real-time accessibility of urban rail transit stations in six North American
  cities, assisting users in making informed decisions regarding their commute. Specifcally,
  UnlockedMaps uses a map to display transit stations, prominently highlighting their
  real-time accessibility status (accessible with functioning elevators, accessible
  but experiencing at least one elevator outage, or not-accessible) and surrounding
  accessible restaurants and restrooms. UnlockedMaps is the frst system to collect
  elevator outage data from 2,336 transit stations over 23 months and make it publicly
  available via an API. We report on results from our pilot user studies with fve
  stakeholder groups: (1) people with mobility disabilities; (2) pregnant people;
  (3) cyclists/stroller users/commuters with heavy equipment; (4) members of disability
  advocacy groups; and (5) civic hackers.'
