abstract: The ubiquity of Wi-Fi infrastructure has facilitated the development of
  a range of Wi-Fi based sensing applications. Wi-Fi sensing relies on weak signal
  reflections from the human target and thus only supports a limited sensing range,
  which significantly hinders the real-world deployment of the proposed sensing systems.
  To extend the sensing range, traditional algorithms focus on suppressing the noise
  introduced by the imperfect Wi-Fi hardware. This paper picks a different direction
  and proposes to enhance the quality of the sensing signal by fully exploiting the
  signal diversity provided by the Wi-Fi hardware. We propose DiverSense, a system
  that combines sensing signal received from all subcarriers and all antennas in the
  array, to fully utilize the spatial and frequency diversity. To guarantee the diversity
  gain after signal combining, we also propose a time-diversity based signal alignment
  algorithm to align the phase of the multiple received sensing signals. We implement
  the proposed methods in a respiration monitoring system using commodity Wi-Fi devices
  and evaluate the performance in diverse environments. Extensive experimental results
  demonstrate that DiverSense is able to accurately monitor the human respiration
  even when the sensing signal is under noise floor, and therefore boosts sensing
  range to 40 meters, which is a 3x improvement over the current state-of-the-art.
  DiverSense also works robustly under NLoS scenarios, e.g., DiverSense is able to
  accurately monitor respiration even when the human and the Wi-Fi transceivers are
  separated by two concrete walls with wooden doors.
