abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic upended college education and the experiences of students
  due to the rapid and uneven shift to online learning. This study examined the experiences
  of students with disabilities with online learning, with a consideration of surrounding
  stressors such as financial pressures. In a mixed method approach, we compared 28
  undergraduate students with disabilities (including mental health concerns) to their
  peers during 2020, to assess differences and similarities in their educational concerns,
  stress levels and COVID-19 related adversities. We found that students with disabilities
  entered the Spring quarter of 2020 with significantly higher concerns about classes
  going online, and reported more recent negative life events than other students.
  These differences between the two groups diminished three months later with the
  exception of recent negative life events. For a fuller understanding of students’
  experiences, we conducted qualitative analysis of open ended interviews. We examined
  both positive and negative experiences with online learning among students with
  disabilities and mental health concerns. We describe how online learning enabled
  greater access–e.g., reducing the need for travel to campus–alongside ways in which
  online learning impeded academic engagement–e.g., reducing interpersonal interaction.
  We highlight a need for learning systems to meet the diverse and dynamic needs of
  students with disabilities.
