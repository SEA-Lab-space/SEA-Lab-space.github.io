 abstract = {Smartphone overuse is related to a variety of issues such as lack of sleep and anxiety. We explore the application of Self-Afrmation Theory on smartphone overuse intervention in a just-in-time manner. We present TypeOut, a just-in-time intervention technique that integrates two components: an in-situ typing-based unlock process to improve user engagement, and self-afrmation-based typing content to enhance efectiveness. We hypothesize that the integration of typing and self-afrmation content can better reduce smartphone overuse. We conducted a 10-week within-subject feld experiment (N=54) and compared TypeOut against two baselines: one only showing the self-afrmation content (a common notifcation-based intervention), and one only requiring typing non-semantic content (a state-of-the-art method). TypeOut reduces app usage by over 50%, and both app opening frequency and usage duration by over 25%, all signifcantly outperforming baselines. TypeOut can potentially be used in other domains where an intervention may beneft from integrating self-afrmation exercises with an engaging just-in-time mechanism.},
