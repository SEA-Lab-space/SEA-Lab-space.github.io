abstract: 'Smartphone overuse is related to a variety of issues such as lack of sleep
  and anxiety. We explore the application of Self-Afrmation Theory on smartphone overuse
  intervention in a just-in-time manner. We present TypeOut, a just-in-time intervention
  technique that integrates two components: an in-situ typing-based unlock process
  to improve user engagement, and self-afrmation-based typing content to enhance efectiveness.
  We hypothesize that the integration of typing and self-afrmation content can better
  reduce smartphone overuse. We conducted a 10-week within-subject feld experiment
  (N=54) and compared TypeOut against two baselines: one only showing the self-afrmation
  content (a common notifcation-based intervention), and one only requiring typing
  non-semantic content (a state-of-the-art method). TypeOut reduces app usage by over
  50%, and both app opening frequency and usage duration by over 25%, all signifcantly
  outperforming baselines. TypeOut can potentially be used in other domains where
  an intervention may beneft from integrating self-afrmation exercises with an engaging
  just-in-time mechanism.'
