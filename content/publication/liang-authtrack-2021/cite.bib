 abstract = {We propose Auth+Track, a novel authentication model that aims to reduce redundant authentication in everyday smartphone usage. By sparse authentication and continuous tracking of the user’s status, Auth+Track eliminates the "gap" authentication between fragmented sessions and enables "Authentication Free when User is Around". To instantiate the Auth+Track model, we present PanoTrack, a prototype that integrates body and near feld hand information for user tracking. We install a fsheye camera on the top of the phone to achieve a panoramic vision that can capture both user’s body and on-screen hands. Based on the captured video stream, we develop an algorithm to extract 1) features for user tracking, including body keypoints and their temporal and spatial association, near feld hand status, and 2) features for user identity assignment. The results of our user studies validate the feasibility of PanoTrack and demonstrate that Auth+Track not only improves the authentication efciency but also enhances user experiences with better usability.},
