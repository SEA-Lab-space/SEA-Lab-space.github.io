abstract: We propose Auth+Track, a novel authentication model that aims to reduce
  redundant authentication in everyday smartphone usage. By sparse authentication
  and continuous tracking of the user’s status, Auth+Track eliminates the \"gap\"
  authentication between fragmented sessions and enables \"Authentication Free when
  User is Around\". To instantiate the Auth+Track model, we present PanoTrack, a prototype
  that integrates body and near feld hand information for user tracking. We install
  a fsheye camera on the top of the phone to achieve a panoramic vision that can capture
  both user’s body and on-screen hands. Based on the captured video stream, we develop
  an algorithm to extract 1) features for user tracking, including body keypoints
  and their temporal and spatial association, near feld hand status, and 2) features
  for user identity assignment. The results of our user studies validate the feasibility
  of PanoTrack and demonstrate that Auth+Track not only improves the authentication
  efciency but also enhances user experiences with better usability.
