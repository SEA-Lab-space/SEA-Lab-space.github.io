abstract: "Despite the plethora of telehealth applications to assist home-based older
  adults and healthcare providers, basic messaging and phone calls are still the most
  common communication methods, which suffer from limited availability, information
  loss, and process inefficiencies. One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider
  communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural
  conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding
  of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies
  with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their
  needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication.
  Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care,
  and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged
  the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered
  conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers,
  we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information
  based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user
  studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system.
  The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich
  the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers'
  efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability
  in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."
