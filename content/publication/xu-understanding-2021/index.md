abstract: Passive mobile sensing for the purpose of human state modeling is a fast-growing
  area. It has been applied to solve a wide range of behavior-related problems, including
  physical and mental health monitoring, affective computing, activity recognition,
  routine modeling, etc. However, in spite of the emerging literature that has investigated
  a wide range of application scenarios, there is little work focusing on the lessons
  learned by researchers, and on guidance for researchers to this approach. How do
  researchers conduct these types of research studies? Is there any established common
  practice when applying mobile sensing across different application areas? What are
  the pain points and needs that they frequently encounter? Answering these questions
  is an important step in the maturing of this growing sub-field of ubiquitous computing,
  and can benefit a wide range of audiences. It can serve to educate researchers who
  have growing interests in this area but have little to no previous experience. Intermediate
  researchers may also find the results interesting and helpful for reference to improve
  their skills. Moreover, it can further shed light on the design guidelines for a
  future toolkit that could facilitate research processes being used. In this paper,
  we fill this gap and answer these questions by conducting semi-structured interviews
  with ten experienced researchers from four countries to understand their practices
  and pain points when conducting their research. Our results reveal a common pipeline
  that researchers have adopted, and identify major challenges that do not appear
  in published work but that researchers often encounter. Based on the results of
  our interviews, we discuss practical suggestions for novice researchers and high-level
  design principles for a toolkit that can accelerate passive mobile sensing research.
