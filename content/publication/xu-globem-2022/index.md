abstract: Recent research has demonstrated the capability of behavior signals captured
  by smartphones and wearables for longitudinal behavior modeling. However, there
  is a lack of a comprehensive public dataset that serves as an open testbed for fair
  comparison among algorithms. Moreover, prior studies mainly evaluate algorithms
  using data from a single population within a short period, without measuring the
  cross-dataset generalizability of these algorithms. We present the first multi-year
  passive sensing datasets, containing over 700 user-years and 497 unique users’ data
  collected from mobile and wearable sensors, together with a wide range of well-being
  metrics. Our datasets can support multiple cross-dataset evaluations of behavior
  modeling algorithms’ generalizability across different users and years. As a starting
  point, we provide the benchmark results of 18 algorithms on the task of depression
  detection. Our results indicate that both prior depression detection algorithms
  and domain generalization techniques show potential but need further research to
  achieve adequate cross-dataset generalizability. We envision our multi-year datasets
  can support the ML community in developing generalizable longitudinal behavior modeling
  algorithms.
